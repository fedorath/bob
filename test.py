# FACE DETECTION
# -----------------------
# Graphical version - Will only work from the desktop (enter command 'startx')
# -----------------------
# Simple face detection for the camera module using SimpleCV.
# This will continuously capture images and search them for human features. Which features can be set
# under 'detect()' below.
# As an output, the latest frame will be displayed on-screen with each feature highlighted by a green square.
#------------------------
