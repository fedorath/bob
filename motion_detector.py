# FACE DETECTION
# --------------------
# Command line version
# --------------------
# Simple face-detecting script for the camera module using SimpleCV.
# This will continuously take images and search them for himan features. Which features can 
# be set on the line 'faces = img.findHaarFeatures('face.xml').
# As an out put it will print the coordinates for each face detected.
#---------------------
